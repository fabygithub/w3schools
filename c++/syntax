Insert the missing part of the code below to output "Hello World!".

int main() {
cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}


Insert a new line after "Hello World", by using a special character:

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World! \n";
  cout << "I am learning C++";
  return 0;
}

Comments in C++ are written with special characters. Insert the missing parts:


//This is a single-line comment
/*This is a multi-line comment */


Create a variable named myNum and assign the value 50 to it.

int myNum = 50;


Display the sum of 5 + 10, using two variables: x and y.

int x = 5;
int y = 10;
cout << x + y;

Create a variable called z, assign x + y to it, and display the result.
int x = 5;
int y = 10;
int z = x + y;
cout << z;

Fill in the missing parts to create three variables of the same type, using a comma-separated list:

int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;
